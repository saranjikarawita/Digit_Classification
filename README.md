# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project demonstrates the process of loading, exploring, visualizing, and preparing the MNIST dataset for training a neural network model to classify handwritten digits using TensorFlow.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using a deep learning model. The project includes the following steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Importing the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.
2. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and test sets.
3. **Data Exploration**: Checking the number of images and their dimensions in the training and test sets.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing a random image and its label from the training set.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing the images to improve model performance.
6. **Model Building**: Creating and training a neural network model using TensorFlow.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.
8. **Prediction**: Making predictions on new handwritten digit images.
